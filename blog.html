    <p style="font-family:verdena"><H5>I used to write. I don't know what has changed, but I haven't writtein in a while. Maybe, before, I was 'forced' to write because of school--Sure was glad about that. Anyways, I had always felt that I didn't verbally communicate my thoughts well and so this one teach told me to slap it down on paper. Still a brillant idea til today! I'll carry this out by blogging then.</p></H5>
    <p><H5>Being bilingual is hard work. English is my second language and Vietnamese is my first. As a kid (Even til now), I still struggle with stupid grammer. (Note to nazi grammars: Don't read on if you can't handle...But positive feedback would be greatly appreciated). Often times I do find my writing a bit strange especially with the way I like to structure my sentences or syntax. Why? Because I like how it looks and flows. Shows how I would normally talk. I'm just giving my writing... A voice?</p>
    <p>Anywho, hopefully starting a blog would change how I can better communicate iin a non-alienish way and help me become a better writer. This isn't for anyone, it's for myself--but if one post can resonate with someone, I'll be damn happy.</p></H5>

    <p><H5>I was always worried if my salary would be enough to pay for my student loans then I studdenly realized: when I start focusing more on other things other than money, the money made itself. When you do focus on money, you lose focus on other things that make life worth living; you lose the focus of building a great friendship with people around you, you lose the ability to function like a human being - to feel the experience. You love the chance to live.</p></H5><br />
